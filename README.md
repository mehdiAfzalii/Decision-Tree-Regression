Overview
This project demonstrates how to use a Decision Tree Regressor to predict salaries based on position levels. A sample dataset, Position_Salaries.csv, containing levels and corresponding salaries, is used to train the model. The Decision Tree algorithm is particularly useful for capturing non-linear relationships in datasets, which can make it suitable for such a prediction problem.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
Install the required libraries using:

bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Code Description
Dataset Import: The dataset is loaded, and features (x) and target (y) variables are extracted.
Model Training: A DecisionTreeRegressor model is instantiated and trained on the position-salary data.
Prediction: The model predicts the salary for a specified position level (in this case, level 7).
Visualization: The results are visualized using a scatter plot for actual data points and a line plot for the model's predictions, highlighting the Decision Treeâ€™s behavior with non-linear data.
Usage
Replace Position_Salaries.csv with your own dataset, ensuring it has columns for position levels and salaries. Run the code to train the model and visualize predictions.

Output
A graph displaying the actual vs. predicted salaries helps illustrate the model's performance on the dataset.
